Security Measures – Write a bash script that can encrypt a file using OpenSSL , moves the encrypted file to another location in the system (this should simulate a file transfer between 2 servers in production), and decrypts it automatically there. Please use at least 2 other block ciphers (instead of CBC, use for example ECB, GCM, CFB, CTR)

Study OpenSSL – Cryptographic command

Encryption command:
Openssl enc –aes-256-cbc –salt –in file.txt –out file.enc –k “parola”

Move to another location

Decryption command:
Openssl enc –d –aes-256-cbc –in file.enc –out file.txt –k “parola”

Check each file (enc, txt) with “cat” command

Enc – mentions that we want to encrypt/decrypt with openssl
Aes-256-cbc – symmetric encryption algorithm on 256 bits using a CBC block cipher
Salt – random number added to encrypted file for security (generated automatically)
In – input
Out – output
k – mentions we need to use a password for decryption
D – in decryption command, it means decrypt
